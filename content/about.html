<p>When researching for my first offering of a programming course at IIT Gandhinagar, I was quickly overwhelmed by (and also grateful for) all the <a href="/resources/">great resources</a> that I could find to learn Python.</p>
<p>However, I was in a situation where the classes were held in a non-lab environment (i.e: no computers). I considered the possibility of making every class a live coding session, and potentially recording screencasts to share with the class.</p>
<p>However, after watching the the lectures from the <a href="https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc16_cs11/preview">NPTEL course on Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms in Python</a>, I realized that creating slides was perhaps a more organized way of delivering the material.</p>
<p>I explored using Pythontutor and embedding REPLs from REPL.it in the class.</p>
