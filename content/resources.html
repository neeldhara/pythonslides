<p>Whether you are a student or professional looking to teach yourself Python, or a teacher looking for resources that can add some excitement to your class, there are plenty of resources online, and I’m sure you can find something that fits your use case.</p>

<li>Video Course: <a href="https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc16_cs11/preview">NPTEL course on Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms in Python</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Many of the slides on this website are inspired by the flow of content in this course. While there is a strong algorithms backdrop, this is a great introduction to Python.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Text: <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate the boring stuff with Python</a></li>
</ol>
<p>This book has some nice practical information for things like cleaning up data in files, scraping the web, and so forth.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Video Course: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZm9yAYmyIBidTka0c9PgGRehJvbPMM1h">Python for Everyone</a></li>
</ol>
<p>A popular and solid introduction to the language. I believe a version of this runs on Coursera as well.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Video Course: <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/">The MIT OCW Course on Python</a></li>
</ol>
<p><em>From the website:</em> Many of the problem sets focus on specific topics, such as virus population dynamics, word games, optimizing routes, or simulating the movement of a Roomba.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Video Course: Coursera’s Introduction to Interactive Programming with Python, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-2">Part 2</a>, offered by Rice University</li>
</ol>
<p>This has some emphasis on interactive programming, and most of the exercises revolve around building games. This is one of the very few Coursera courses that I did from start to finish because it was so much fun!</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/">Google’s Python Class</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Some real-world training, and yet fairly accessible.</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="http://www.datacamp.com">Datacamp</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The first module in all courses are free. The backdrop is often data science and this makes for very interesting assignments and projects. This also means that there is a lot of early emphasis on packages like NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib.</p>
<p>Similar platforms include <a href="http://pluralsight.com/">Pluralsight</a> and <a href="http://codeacademy.com/">Codeacademy</a>. Most of these are partially free - I recommend watching out for Back to School, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday sales if you are not in a hurry.</p>
